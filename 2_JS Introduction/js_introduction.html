    <h2>Australian company founded by Bangladeshi exceeds $1B valuation</h2>
    <p>Deputy, an Australian software company specialising in workforce management, has recently reached a valuation of over US$1 billion, making it the first Australian tech 'unicorn' in two years. Co-founded by Ashik Ahmed, a Bangladeshi immigrant, Deputy was able to reach this milestone thanks to a US$37 million investment from Express Employment Professionals, a US-based staffing company.</p>  
    <p>The report by AFR adds that Express Employment Professionals, initially considered a potential customer by Deputy, was so impressed at Deputy's service that it opted to buy a stake instead, putting the Australian company at over US$1.1 billion valuation in total.</p>
